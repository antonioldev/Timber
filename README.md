## Timber

This was my first step into game development using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) library. SFML made things like rendering graphics and handling input much easier, especially as I was just starting out. Timber is a simple game where the player chops down trees while avoiding branches. While working on this project, I learned how to create a game loop, which is essential for continuously updating the game state and rendering graphics.

Key takeaways from the Timber project:

**Basic SFML Integration**: I learned how to set up SFML in a C++ project and use it to create windows, handle input, and render shapes and sprites.
**Game Loop**: I implemented a fundamental game loop that manages the game's timing, logic, and rendering.
**Event Handling**: I explored how to handle keyboard input, which is key for interacting with a game.
**Sprites and Textures**: This project introduced me to the concepts of using textures and sprites to represent game objects visually.
At this point, I was starting to understand how SFML makes game development more accessible, even when building something as simple as Timber. It opened my eyes to the power of libraries in abstracting complex multimedia operations.



## SFML Library
Throughout these projects, I used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).W
hich is a cross-platform library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++.
SFML is particularly useful for game development due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Key Features**:
- **Graphics**: Rendering shapes, sprites, and text. SFML makes it easy to draw 2D graphics and handle basic animations.
- **Windowing**: Creating and managing game windows. SFML provides a straightforward way to create windows and handle events such as resizing and closing.
- **Audio**: Playing sound effects and music. SFML supports various audio formats and allows for easy playback and control of sounds.
- **Input**: Handling keyboard, mouse, and joystick input. SFML simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user inputs.

SFML has been a great starting point for learning the basics of game programming. It handles many of the lower-level tasks like rendering, input management, and audio playback, which allowed me to focus on learning game logic and design. Through each project, I explored new features of SFML and honed my C++ skills.
