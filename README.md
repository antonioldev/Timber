## Timber
In the Timber project, I developed a fast-paced game inspired by the popular mobile game Timberman. The objective is to chop down trees while avoiding branches that fall from above.

**Key Points**:
- Basics of C++ Programming**: I learned how to set up a game window using SFML, handle user input, and manage game states.
- Game Loops**: I understood the concept of game loops, which are essential for keeping the game running smoothly by continuously updating the game state and rendering graphics.
- Graphics Rendering**: I gained hands-on experience with simple graphics rendering, including drawing sprites and handling basic animations.
- Collision Detection**: I implemented basic collision detection to determine when the player character gets hit by a branch.

## SFML Library
Throughout these projects, I used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).W
hich is a cross-platform library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components in C++.
SFML is particularly useful for game development due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Key Features**:
- **Graphics**: Rendering shapes, sprites, and text. SFML makes it easy to draw 2D graphics and handle basic animations.
- **Windowing**: Creating and managing game windows. SFML provides a straightforward way to create windows and handle events such as resizing and closing.
- **Audio**: Playing sound effects and music. SFML supports various audio formats and allows for easy playback and control of sounds.
- **Input**: Handling keyboard, mouse, and joystick input. SFML simplifies the process of capturing and responding to user inputs.
